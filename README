Dear reviewer,

Thank you for taking the time to access this article in its natural form (HTML and friends).

Enclosed here are all of the files you need to read this article offline on your local machine. It should open in any Web browser and conform to the appearance you'd expect from an LNCS-templated paper if you choose to print it out. However, if you do experience difficulties with this radical and futuristic technology, we include a PDF version for your convenience. Due to deficiences in these formats, hyperlinks will be ineffective in physical paper form, and embedded videos will work in neither (but the video cover image should suffice).

If you wish to engage further, we encourage you to access this article at its canonical URL: http://csarven.ca/linked-data-notifications

There, you will be able to post your reviews publicly if you like, and be attributed for your contributions.

We appreciate the time you take to give us feedback.

Keep rocking the open Web.

Sincerely,

The authors.
